\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

\section{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item location-based applications borad appeal (navigation, robotics, gaming, asset tracking, ...)
\item no GPS, loss of signal, or very bad accuracy
\end{itemize}

\section{Idea}

Use approach from robotics.

Ein Grund Q/A [Apple intro], says it is not possible to show precise location.

UseCase:
\begin{itemize}
  \item (assets management, staff tracking,) indoor tourist guiding in museums, train stations, airport, shopping complex \cite{wang_2013}
  \item example ADAMANT (airport travelers guide) \cite{wang_2013}
\end{itemize}

Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item low cost
\item public available device
\item cross platform
\item every thing on device \cite{wang_2013}
\item easy-to-deploy \cite{wang_2013}
\end{itemize}
